Again not a whole lot of activity on my side. The client is pretty quiet especially since Leon is now on vacation and everyone seems to have settled in gotten what they need from the project. There are still a couple kinks popping up once and a while but not alot of them are that big just minor issues usually related to user error or something we did not expect to encounter in the earlier phases of the project.
