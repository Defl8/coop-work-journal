Again not a whole lot of activity on my side. The client is pretty quiet
especially since Leon is now on vacation and everyone seems to have settled in
gotten what they need from the project. There are still a couple kinks popping
up once and a while but not a lot of them are that big just minor issues usually
related to user error or something we did not expect to encounter in the earlier
phases of the project. I have just continued some development on the program I
have been working on. I decided to encompass all the data for the inputs in two
separate class instances. I have never really used classes in C# before but
after using them today they were kind of nice to use. I like the built in getter
and setter for properties. The syntax is nice and simple especially if you don't
want to do any special value handling. The only real value handling I did was
for the min and max ranges, I made an object. The Range object just has a min
and max property, to store the ranges. Each of the instances of the classes has
a member that stores the upper and lower range of the data set that the class
instance represents. There is only one method for the classes. The method just
clears all the items from the "Data" property so that if the user reloads a
different file with different data the variables will be cleared for the next
set of data. Anyway that's about it for today.
