One, he likes BBQ second for my last couple weeks at DCD. Kieran was bugging him for doing something for my last couple weeks here like a nice dinner or something. I much prefer a homemade BBQ. This is pretty much my motivation for the week. Not much activity from the client, still waiting on responses from the business side. So there isn't really a whole lot for me to do for them. A lot of yesterdays development on the program was trying to figure how to handle the combo boxes used to select which column is which variable for the program. I implemented logic that would delete the selected value for one of the combo box if it was chosen in the other. If there is only two columns of data then the combo boxes automatically fill each other when one column is selected. I am now debating how to handle each of the variable inputs for the program. I am thinking structs to store all the data for the variable and to keep track of them easier, since all the data is in one spot. I might also experiment with C# classes since I have never really done anything with them despite all winforms app being built inside of a form class which represents
