So Sean and I ran into some problems with SQL today. Earlier in the month I made the molar ratio calculation table to handle the problem we had with the calculation on the backend. We noticed that one of them had a static value for a couple of times during the day. The formula divided the two base tags and then multiplied the result by 3.45, then inserted the value under the appropriate tag name.
