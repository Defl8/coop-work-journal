So Sean and I ran into some problems with SQL today. Earlier in the month I made the molar ratio calculation table to handle the problem we had with the calculation on the backend. We noticed that one of them had a static value for a couple of times during the day. The formula divided the two base tags and then multiplied the result by 3.45, then inserted the value under the appropriate tag name. The problem is the division is resulting in 1 which shouldn't happen. So some further investigating took place, and we found out that the values as to which are evaluating as 1 are happening when the values entered for the base tags are entered as integers and not floating pointing numbers. This resulted in integer division which causes the result to be truncated meaning that digits before the decimal point are the actual results. Hence the division resulting to 1. So I tried modifying the stored procedures that are used for this table in SQL to force numbers to be floats. I did this in multiple spots to attempt to remain consistent across everything. Despite my best efforts that did not work though. It seems that the base SQL config, that is where the table stores the history values. It seems to convert floats that have trailing zeroes,
