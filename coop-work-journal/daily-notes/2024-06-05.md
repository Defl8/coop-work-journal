Well, finally wrapped up report verification. It's been a long time coming and even Sean was very excited for me. This was a major chunk of work needed to be done for the company that employed us. Now that Sean is tackling the engineering unit side of things, there wasn't a whole lot left for me to do. Then Sean had me setup a PC for some sort crane that isn't built at the moment so that was pretty fun. It was a simple task overall, the pc already windows it just needed a new local user, the workgroup changed and some other standard config options. Then he had me transfer the iso files for the software suite the pc needs from the company server. This took a bit as the files were compressed but still not small. Once the files were transferred Sean helped me configure the AVEVA software suite components. But we ran out of time as was shift was quickly approaching its end, so we decided to pause and wait till tomorrow.
