Well today I wrapped up testing on my HMI. The alarm bundles are definitely what took the longest was the alarm bundles which are basically just pages of different alarms. Jeff helped me fix the issue I was having with the bypass buttons. The bypass buttons are meant to allow controls to keep operating despite them having an alarm. This for when the alarm is not valid or unecessary and just hasn't been fixed yet. When this button is clicked a prompt should show where the operator has to write a reason for bypass the alarm and when other users clicked the same bypass button they can see the reason and decide to remove the bypass or not. He explained to me that there are 7 HMI's used by this and the 2nd HMI is where they decided to store all of the SQL prompts. If they weren't all on a central location then only users on a given HMI would be able to see prompts from that HMI instead of all the others.
