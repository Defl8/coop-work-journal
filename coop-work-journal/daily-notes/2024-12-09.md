Pretty quiet again today, did a little bit of work for the client but pretty much radio silence today. I got to do some work for Matt today. I made a script awhile ago that converts local trends to web trends by generating SQL statements that insert the JSON data for the trends into the table of the DB. The script didn't seem to work though, not because it had been changed in some way but because it was being used on an older version of web trends. This older version doesn't use the same URL scheme as the newer version of the web trends app. So something that is different fundamentally that cause the way my script inserts the trends.
