Pretty quiet again today, did a little bit of work for the client but pretty much radio silence today. I got to do some work for Matt today. I made a script awhile ago that converts local trends to web trends by generating SQL statements that insert the JSON data for the trends into the table of the DB. The script didn't seem to work though, not because it had been changed in some way but because it was being used on an older version of web trends. This older version doesn't use the same URL scheme as the newer version of the web trends app. So something that is different fundamentally that cause the way my script inserts the trends. So that was a bit disappointing, but I had no way of really knowing it would happen so not much point in worrying over it. The company this was for didn't even know they were paying for the web trends app, so it is unlikely anyway that they would be on the latest version anyway. Luckily it doesn't seem like they have many trends anyway, less than 10 from what I saw. Otherwise I have just been chipping away at the other program. The data tab is taking awhile to make since there is so much handling for all the specific cases. But such is the problem with things that take a bunch of user input. Hopefully all the effort will be worth it in the end. Anyway that is pretty much it for today. See ya tomorrow.
