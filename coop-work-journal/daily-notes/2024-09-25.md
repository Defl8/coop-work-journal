The table contains these tags and the formula used for calculation. The query I wrote iterates over the whole table then uses some built in stored procedures from the client database. These stored procedures let me pull the current value and current date, then it compares the current date of the tags used for calculation and then compares that to the tag that stores the result. If the date from the tag used for the calculation is newer then the calculation will be performed and the new value manually inserted under the result tag name. To interpret the formula it basically accepts the formula as text then converts all the variables used to store the values under the calculation tags. Then there is a pre baked SQL server stored procedure tha
