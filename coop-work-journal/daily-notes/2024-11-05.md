Well well well today is the day, SQL script over haul day. First things first I want to update the script to able to handle 4 variables instead of just 2. This would basically cover all the tags that need calculations in the db. This was relatively easy since the items to make it were already in place to allow me to be able to add more. Now that the table has two extra columns for every row holding the potential third and fourth, we need to handle if the column has more than two things calculating or not. To do this is simple. If the column has a certain thing indicating that there is no value in the column's defining extra values for calculation. In this case I chose 'none'. So we just have to check if that column is containing 'none' or not and if it is then we do nothing otherwise we treat it like the other tags in the calculation process. Then pretty much the same thing happens as the old one the dates get compared to find the latest then if their is a new date the calculation is performed and the value get's inserted into the db
