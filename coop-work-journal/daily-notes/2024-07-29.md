# 2024-07-29
New week and I'm ready to work. I continued building out Chris's script. I
managed to get it in better working condition but when I ran it with all 60 of
the files in the folder. It took around 15 minutes. This is not acceptable by my
means. Chris seemed happy with it which is good, but I am not satisfied. I
shouldn't have been surprised it took long though to be fair because the script
had to process 2.1 million rows of data. So I decided to use numpy and pandas
which I wasn't before since I found out that they are capable of drastically
improving data analysis times. I not particularly familiar with the libraries so
there will be some learning involved but I'm excited to help improve my skills.
Also Shane came by for the site visit. It went really well, we talked about how
I've been doing on the job and things the program could improve. Matt gave me
some praise for the work I've been doing and commented on my good work which is
nice hear. Shane also discussed some plans they have for the program.
Overall it was good that the site visit went well. I continue tomorrow.
