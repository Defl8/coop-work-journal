New week and I'm ready to work. I continued building out Chris's script. I managed to get it in better working condition but when I ran it with all 60 of the files in the folder. It took around 15 minutes. This is not acceptable by my means. Chris seemed happy with it which is good, but I am not satisfied. I shouldn't have been surprised it took long though to be fair because the script had to process 2.1 million rows of data
