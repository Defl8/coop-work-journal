Doing more HMI development today. Today I was mostly focused on making the alarm bundle pages for the HMI. Basically they let the operator check all the alarms for similar controls on the site on one screen. It also gives a brief summary of what could be going on if there was a fault or a communication error or something along those lines. This basically involves me putting down a graphic and linking the alarm tag to the graphic to cause a colour change in the graphic when the alarm state changes. The tags that handle the alarms are like Boolean variables that only have two states, true or false. If the alarm is true that means something is wrong and the graphic will turn to some sort of red colour usually. If it's false (which is most of the time) then the graphic will remain green. This is a super cool way of turning simple logic into something more meaningful using PLCs. The alarms on this screen also have a bypass which allow permitted users to turn off the alarms and allow the control to continue functioning as if there was no alarm. There is usually a reason for this but sometimes alarms can be faulty and need to be bypassed. Building out these windows was pretty easy as there are a lot of similar windows.
