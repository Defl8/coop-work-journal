# 2024-05-09
Came into the office earlier today. It's was really quiet today, it seems that
not alot of people were here at the office. Maybe they were working online at
home? Anyway, my boss Sean was on site today doing a training sessions instead
of the usual online teaching sessions. Either way I was still chewing through
reports and I got a good chunk done today.  Towards the latter end of the day,
Sean had me start fixing the engineering units used by the system. For some
reason, there is a bunch of the same units just capitalized differently but
meaning the same thing. So I'm currently going through and adjusting all of
those to reach an agreement on a standard with the operations team. I also
learned that a ton and a tonne are not the same thing. One of them is
technically a metric unit but not recognized by SI. Also there is a short and a
long ton which have about 100 kg difference in measurement for some reason. All
in all, a success full day.
