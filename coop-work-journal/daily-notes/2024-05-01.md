Did some initial onboarding, mainly signing standard tax documents, company
agreements and policy reviews. The secretary also gave me a tour of the office,
introduced me to all of the employees currently in office and showed me where I
would be working. I worked with Kieran a little bit observing some database
work, tracking functionalities. Then my supervisor who was not in office invited
me to a meeting to expose me to the data historian software that tracks data
trends and allows users to make custom dashboards for tracking specific data
sets. Although I do not completely understand what is happening in regard to the
software it was cool to see how the software makes data easier to read and
track. During the latter end of the meeting, I also got my account setup for the
company Sean (my supervisor) and I would be doing work for. Most of the tech
seems be running on a virtual machine, usually on an older version of Windows,
and is accessed remotely. I was also shown the spreadsheet holding all the
information I would be compiling and explained as to what some of the data
meant. So far I don't understand a whole lot but I am feeling apprehensive and
excited to learn!
