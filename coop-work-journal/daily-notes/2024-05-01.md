Did some initial onboarding, mainly signing standard tax documents, company agreements and policy reviews. The secretary also gave me a tour of the office, introduced me to all of the employees currently in office and showed me where I would be working. I worked with Kieran a little bit observing some database work, tracking functionalities. Then my supervisor who was not in office invited me to a meeting to expose me to the data historian software that tracks data trends and allows users to make custom dashboards for tracking specific data sets. Although I do not completely understand what is happening in regard to the software it was cool to see how the software makes data easier to read and track.
