Well after a brutal sick day, I'm back at the office continuing on with HMI stuff. Today I called with Shane, who seems to be leading this HMI stuff. He instructed me that he update the graphics with the correct properties like Jeff and I were trying to do earlier in the week. He did them for both HMI's so now it was up to me to go through and fix some things. He told me that I now needed to go change the default values for all of the newly updated graphics with the changed custom properties. This involved going into each window and manually changing each value of the graphic, multiple times if there are many graphics. This proved to be pretty lengthy as the graphic we changed are used for alarms and a lot of the windows have alarms that contain the graphic. Then he said once I'm done with that I can go through and change the window properties of every popup type window
