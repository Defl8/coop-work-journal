More head banging trying to figure out the template situation. I got the template to a state where I can replicate the old system data with the new system data in the same location on a different sheet. The problem is we want the data to be organized in a way so that you can do 1 query per retrieval method. This will speed up building out the spreadsheet and the query times for the spreadsheet as since Sean and the clients made the executive decision to stick to the old add in for excel. This one is a lot more like the query tool which is nice because if you're are familiar with query tool then it makes the extension super easy to use. The problem I'm running into is making a serviceable template to be used for future sheets.
