Some big progress made, leach shift supervisor finally passed after lot's of work this has been the most difficult report to make progress on of mine. For me there isn't much else other than the spreadsheets to convert. I have been taking back and forth with Via who is responsible for my spreadsheet and giving me feedback on the conversion process. The main issue we have been running through is there are actually some tag mismatches. These are tags that are used in like one location and no where else so a very select group of people don't use it very often. We found out that one the manual entry tags is actually in different units in Aveva versus their old system. The tag in the old system is metric tonnes and the tag in the aveva system is in kilograms
