Today flew by, despite not working on much of a variety of things.  I got to use
some more python today to filter values in a spreadsheet. I'm liking using
python for these large data sets (number of rows > 1000) because it allows me to
abstract and containerize functions rather than having a huge formula bar in
excel. It also allows to fine tune the functionality of the filtering and
manipulation as precisely as needed. It has also taught me how to do some
spreadsheet manipulation using the openpyxl module.  I also learned a bit more
regular expression pattern matching with Excel does not natively support. I was
mostly independent today since Sean was on site doing in person training
sessions. Overall, a productively feeling day that just flew by.
