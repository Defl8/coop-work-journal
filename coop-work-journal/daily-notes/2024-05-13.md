Today I did some more reports for half the day, a good old 4 hours. We were
focusing on manual entry boxes which allow the user to update data via the web
interface itself. This have a little more complexity than the simple objects we
were working with before, they also have some styling issues when placed in
tables. Most of the 4 hours were spent dealing with the styling issues which
aren't fully resolved yet. Progress is steady. Next, I tuned into Sean's OMI
training session, which basically has a visual of the systems being used on
site. The system used to make them is extremely similar to object oriented
programming. You start with a base object that has a very general outline of how
you want all the objects to be, then the specific objects inherit the outline of
the base object, which is effectively polymorphism. Also like objects, they have
functions which are akin to methods and properties which give them unique
attributes. Then Sean tasked me with going through all of the float tags and
setting the min and max to be shown in trends which I am using python to
complete since the data set is quiet large. I will carry on tomorrow.
