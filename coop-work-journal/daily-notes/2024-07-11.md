Today I built out a list of all the trends I had to transfer. However this took
longer than expected because it turns out there is almost 600 trends to
transfer. I did the math and if it took me 5 mins to transfer a report, it would
take me almost a whole week of work to finish up these trends. So naturally I
turn to finding out a quicker way to make the trends into web trends. So I went
into a deep dive to figure out how the web trends actually works. In short, it
makes a GET request to an API that pull the data for the tag then some
JavaScript build the chart. When you save the chart, a POST request is made and
then data is written to the database with one of the columns being the JSON of
the request. So I start by finding the table in the Runtime database where the
chart data was being stored. I eventually found and made a dummy insert
statement to make sure that this concept would work. With some precautions to
prevent issues I executed my statement. And it worked! Then I went to the web
client and couldn't find my trend inserted via the query in the search. I then
went to the URL it should be located at and then it was there! this proves that
this will work. I begin writing the script to build them tomorrow.
