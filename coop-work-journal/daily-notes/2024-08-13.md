I got the excel script working! YAY! I figured out that since the cell references in excel need a leading single quote so they know that they are text, this messed up the matching for the replaceAll() function. This was awesome to get working and will certainly improve things in the future. This pretty much wraps up all the excel style project assuming the script can work on most spreadsheets. This leads to the next task I was given by Matt directly. Basically they have this tool programmed in python that allows you to calculate ideal PID loop tuning values given a data set. This was made by a guy named Ryan and the project is named CLAR with the "R" for Ryan. I don't remember what the other letters mean, but the more important part is that I can now rename the project CLAW, with the W standing for Wyatt. The reason Matt wants me to make this better is because the project is kinda unfinished and in a semi working state. Mainly he wants me to get the once planned linearization feature that doesn't work.
