Wow what a quiet day. Not much activity from the client except for the regular meeting that we have every morning. I started development again on the CLAW program that Matt let me start rewriting a while ago. The program is meant for PID tuning. It was developed by a process engineer and somehow DCD came along and managed to use it. After looking at the source code, you can tell the code base was made by someone who was not a programmer. The ideas behind the code are alright, there are just some syntax errors that still kind of work because python is designed to interpret common syntax mistakes and still make the script function. I did some browsing of the docs of some of the libraries used in his script to see what the code was doing in terms of functionality. I found that alot of the source code seems to be copy pasted from the documentation or slightly modified documentation code examples. This is partially why the program has so much boilerplate code that doesn't really do much for the overall functionality of the program
