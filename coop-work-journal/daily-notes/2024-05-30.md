Today was more report verification. Sean came in today to deal with some calls and setup pc for another client. The report verification was going good but it got to the point where I would be alt tabbing and control f'ing between multiple documents which got quite tedious. So, like I usually do, I made a script to handle all this. Basically the script gets the old system tag name, looks its new system name then finds if the tag is in the list of dead tags, LIMS tags or manual entry tags. This sped me up quite a bit of clicking but made the process much faster. I think this is where my programming skills have really been shining at this job. I may not be doing much programming but I get to make my workflow easier with what knowledge I have, which is fine for me for now. Otherwise, it was business as usual. Sean also told me that the company we are doing work for wants a round 2 of training for operators. This is a big undertaking as they're is about 80 operators that would need to be trained. This give us a lot more work, probably more than when I got brought on to handle this project. That's fine with me as long as it doesn't start bleeding into my day to day life outside of work as it sounds like for some guys that work here it does.
