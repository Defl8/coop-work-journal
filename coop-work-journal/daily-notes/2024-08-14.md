I got to start working on the GUI Project today. I informed Matt that I decided that the best course of action is to basically refactor the whole project from the ground up since the project files I was given are kind of a mess. Building in from the ground with the same functionality will make it easier to scale later on if we decide to develop it further.  This will also allow me to learn a little better while having some source code for reference. I started off by replicating the starting data tab of the original program.
