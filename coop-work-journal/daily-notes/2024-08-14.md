I got to start working on the GUI Project today. I informed Matt that I decided that the best course of action is to basically refactor the whole project from the ground up since the project files I was given are kind of a mess. Building in from the ground with the same functionality will make it easier to scale later on if we decide to develop it further.  This will also allow me to learn a little better while having some source code for reference. I started off by replicating the starting data tab of the original program. This page is where the data file is loaded, the values that contain the axis of data are selected and the data is displayed in a table format. So the interesting part of this project is that it uses a piece of software for the UI design (similar to winforms) and then the file generated by the software get's converted to python code and becomes the structure of the UI. Then in another file where the main process in defined is where you the programmer has to make all the implementations. This is done by inheriting the main class provided by the software then setting functions and/or methods to
