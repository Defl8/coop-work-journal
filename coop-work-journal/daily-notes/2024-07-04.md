Finally got some work today. I much prefer having something to do because it makes the days go by faster. Ryan came by and explained to me that the documentation that they use when they do remote plc testing with clients is kind of scattered in the sense that it doesn't follow a specific format. This is where I come in.  Ryan sent me a document that he already made up and asked me to basically transfer it over to the old template. This old template has some custom properties is the document so that they can be filled all across the document since they are project and FAT specific. Esse
