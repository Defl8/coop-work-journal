# 2024-10-24
Yesterday was a pretty short date for me. This day was spent doing some more report stuff and figuring somethings out. Lane has been messaging a little bit to help with changes so that he doesn't have to risk things randomly changing. I'm fine with this since Lane is very competent when it comes to the work we are doing. He has a deeper understanding compared to most since he seems to have taken Sean's training from when we went to site and actually been able to grow and elaborate on it.
