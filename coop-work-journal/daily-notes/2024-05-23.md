# 2024-05-23
Back at the office today. Sean didn't have me come to the site today because he said he rather me get throughs some more report verification. So get through the verification I did. I have less than 10 reports to verify before I try and go through and fix them. Most of issues with the reports seem to be simple so hopefully the fixes will also be simple as well. This was kind of mind numbing to do today but it was nice to be back in the office and socialize a little bit. On a brighter note, I will get a couple overtime hours since I was at the site for over 8 hours. Overall it was cool to be on site, but definitely less efficient in terms of work done. Despite the size of the company at the site a whole lot of nothing also happens there. It also brought to light the disconnect those running a company and those leading the groups that ultimately allow the company to stay afloat. This made me appreciate working for this smaller company where management is very aware of what is going on at the company.
