Today opened up by entering a training meeting similar to the one on my first day. This one was a bit more lengthy and ran for about four hours. The difference this time around was that I got to follow Sean along and interact with the software. The software as mentioned before is a glorified visualizer of SQL queries made on a database. It also allows for reports generation and manual data entry from users. Overall it is a comprehensive piece of software that seems to do it's job well. After the meeting we had a short meeting with a couple others from the company employing us, discussing how the training session went overall and some things the could improve the software later down the line.
