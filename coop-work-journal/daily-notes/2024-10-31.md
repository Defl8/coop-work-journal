Well some more SQL stuff today for Sean. We went through and tried to figure out some more things related to the SQL table. We both did some investigating as to why certain tags are miscalculating and we found that some have the wrong formulas. This is because in the old system there is a bunch of duplicate tags that do nothing in the old system and we have no idea why they were created in the first place. A side effect of this is that the old (bad) integrator tried to implement everything in the old system and not question anything they were transferring to the new system.
