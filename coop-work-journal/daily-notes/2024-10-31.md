This is because in the old system there is a bunch of duplicate tags that do nothing in the old system and we have no idea why they were created in the first place. A side effect of this is that the old (bad) integrator tried to implement everything in the old system and not question anything they were transferring to the new system. This causes a lot of duplicate tags to show up in AVEVA system. For us to cleanup these tags Sean or some on with access to System Platform has to go in a delete the tags one by one. This can take awhile if there are a ton of tags that he has to delete. Also just extra work on our end. My MR script also doesn't seem to be working for everything, but this is fine for now cause we are planning on upgrading it a little bit at some point to be able to do calculations with more than just two tags. This needs to happen because apparently only being able to do calculations with only two tags only covers around ninety percent of the tags in the system. So, if we upgrade it to be able to ****
