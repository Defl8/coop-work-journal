# 2024-05-21
First day on site.  This is pretty exciting because coming into this job I didn't really expect to be able to actually go to the sites of the companies I'd be working for, so this feels pretty cool. It was also nice to meet the faces of those I had spent training sessions over teams with and really get a feel for the people on the project. It was pretty refreshing to understand how frustrated they are with their old historian system and really want something new, robust and effective. They expressed how they've been banging their heads against the wall and dying for this new system but their were a lot of factors preventing them from reaching this goal. It is a bit odd though because they did have this system in place originally but the way it was configured by a different integrator caused data retrieval to be slow and optimized or non functional. This lead them to just use their old system, but the issue is that the previous supporting company behind this old system no longer does business with them, so if anything were to happen to that system, they would be in the hole.
