# 2024-10-18
Exciting short day today so I do not have much to talk about. I did some final report work and got a couple passed today that needed to be passed. At this point I pretty much caught up. The main thing was getting the testers to test the reports I have updated which can be a hassle. The client employed Jodi to help coordinate this process so I have just gone to messaging her whenever I need the testers to be poked. And poke them she did, the main tester I needed that had a couple reports from them is finally replying to my comments. They informed me that the couple reports I have from them may not be needed in the overall scheme of things. They sent off an email to the operator team that the uses them and hopefully we get a response saying they aren't used so that they can be ignored from here on out
