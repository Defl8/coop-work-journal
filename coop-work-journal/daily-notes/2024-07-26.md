Friday now! I got given a new task this morning. Chris one of the company execs came by and gave me a rundown of what I would be doing. He forwarded me a bunch of daily reports that have values for every second of the day they are sent. He told me that some of the meters reporting these values have problems and that the company that owns them would like to know which ones and have them fixed. He wants to make a script where I dump all these spreadsheets into a folder and then look through each of them to see if any of the measurements are "stale". Stale basically means that the values are repeating indicating an issue with the meter. Then the program need to output a table in excel indicating the name of the report and which of the values are stale if any. Obviously python is pretty much designed for stuff like this. Especially with the openpyxl module which has a lot of nice built in classes for dealing with excel data and files. I built the majority of the processing parts of the scripts. Although I think I am going to make it multithreaded so that it can process all of the files in parallel which should hopefully speed up the program a fair amount so that it doesn't take as long. I continue next week on Monday.
