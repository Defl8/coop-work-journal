Well some good news today. I found another slight issue with my sql job on the server. Turns out by default whenever a script errors in a job the script exits after execution. I did notice these errors  when I was running the script manually but I didn't really think anything of it since I knew the cause of the errors. The errors happen when a tag used in the calculation don't have any values at the latest calculation date, therefore the calculation cannot be performed.  The script doesn't stop when it is running manually but do to the configuration of the sql job the script comes to a halt. Now this is not that difficult to implement a fix. Basically, we need a way of finding the error and running statement when an error is found
