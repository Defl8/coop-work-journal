First day on site, which is very exciting. Not sure what to really expect since the client site is very unique. At first glance the site kind of seems like if you want to the plant process bargain bin and picked a couple things you need and mashed them together. This is mostly because a lot of the plant buildings are old and falling apart. We started off by getting my badge at security so I can sign in an out, then we headed up to the office and I got all my PPE from Leon. Then Jodi came by and gave us the list of control rooms that we need to head to for the day. We then changed up the original plan. Initially we were planning on going to the three different control rooms separately and hitting as many as individuals as possible.
