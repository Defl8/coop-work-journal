Today I continued the development of my script to mass import the script to the web client. I got a lot of good stuff going today which is always nice. I got the script to the point where the user has to input the parameters for the script to run. This includes the file name containing a mass dump of all tags, the column containing the tag names and the sheet the tags are in. This is also the same for the engineering unit for the tags. Then the script goes through the folder it is present in, finds all files that are in csv format ()
