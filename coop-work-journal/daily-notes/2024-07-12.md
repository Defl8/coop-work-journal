Today I continued the development of my script to mass import the script to the web client. I got a lot of good stuff going today which is always nice. I got the script to the point where the user has to input the parameters for the script to run. This includes the file name containing a mass dump of all tags, the column containing the tag names and the sheet the tags are in. This is also the same for the engineering unit for the tags. Then the script goes through the folder it is present in, finds all files that are in csv format (since this is the default export format for the trend desktop app), looks at the top row of the file which contains all the tag names, then goes through the master tag file and finds the engineering units for each of the tags in csv. All that's left to implement now is to generate the JSON object for the tags and for the to build the randomly generated url for the entry. My plan is to have the output be a bunch of insert statements for sql to insert a bunch of different charts all at once. I continue next week.
