More excel work with Sean. I spend all day banging my head against the wall
trying to figure out a good way to make this work. The idea is that I use this
to make a general template for file transfers for the other excel files the
client has. This is made easy in theory since the historian add in excel has
either you can pull raw values into excel or use a function that can generate
and update values in realtime. However this function option needs some
configuration. This is where my gripe arrives. You as a admin are expected to go
the registry editor and change some of the values in the AVEVA configuration
manually to get the full functionality of the add in that the company you work
for paid over 6 figures in most cases to get a license for. Not to mention this
has to be done on every machine that wants to use the excel add in. This is
ridiculous and lazy in my opinion. Unless there is some reason involving the
windows kernel that they can't program this on their end (which I would not
believe on my end) there should be no reason for it to be this way. This is
super lazy from AVEVA on my end especially when they offer a niche product that
costs a ton for people to buy and use. Anyway we closed the day out with a
meeting with the client and discussing some points with the project so far. I
continue tomorrow.
