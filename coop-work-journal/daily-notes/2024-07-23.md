More updates today. I got notice this morning that Sean and I's employer is finalizing their upgrade to the latest 2023 version of the software suite today. Sean CC'd me in some emails and expressed that should be ready and able to help them while they are going through the upgrade today in case anything happens, mainly in terms of reports. During the testing for the upgrade they put on a dev box just to play around with some features they somehow managed to break all of reports and related software. Obviously this is not what we want since it makes reports completely unusable. They later found out it was due to some licensing issues but not even the developers themselves are sure why this happened. They had a couple meeting to try and troubleshoot why this was happening and to see if they could prevent it in the future. Not sure what the exact fix was but they seem to have figured it out. There were still some issues left over though. For the web client it seems they couldn't get anything to load due to some general http request error. This didn't even guess an error code or anything so it seemed like a dead end. Another support request was made and with the team that initially developed the web client software before being acquired by AVEVA. They apparently sent the IT lead that we are doing work for two dll files one for reports and one for the web client.
