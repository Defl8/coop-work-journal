Well guess what more remote support for me. Slowly, slowly chipping away. I got to help David one of the IT members of our client. He was asking me something about SQL which at this point I am very familiar with at this point. Basically there was something wrong with operator comments not going through to the tables or the SQL table it seems like. I did a deep dive and found that the comments were not even making it to the correct SQL table.
