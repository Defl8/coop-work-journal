More script development today. I managed to figure out my previous issue with the y axis not scaling correctly. It's turns out that when you use the `twinx()` method it actually returns the secondary y axis as an object. Before I was just plotting both data sets on the same axes but still creating the the two different axis but I just wasn't using the other one. Once I plotted the other data set it auto scaled and then the graph looked how it should. No updates
