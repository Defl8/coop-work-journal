Today we took another big step forward to the go live for the new system for our employer. Since most of the reports are finished and compiled, we now have to vet their functionality. This morning Sean asked me to make a sheet to track and test all the reports document individual issues with each of their tables or views. This is pretty much going through all the reports again, like I have been since starting. I'm actually quite proud of the sheet I made it works decently well and modular which will allow for updates. It seems like a lot of the tags have broken values or the way they are being queried is incorrect. I say this because a lot of the tables have values displaying "N/A" or "Err" meaning no data or there is null values respectively. This is a problem likely with the tag itself, somewhere along the retrieval line, there could be a typo with the tag or something along those lines. For now
