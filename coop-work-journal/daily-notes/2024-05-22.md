# 2024-05-22
Day two of training. Pretty much just a continuation of yesterday. More in depth
admin stuff and discussion about how we want to containerize each piece of the
software depending on what type of user is accessing it. We decided that a dev
VM would where most users would make and test reports. When the testing and
creation is completed, the report or project would be pushed to a different
production VM where the it would be viewable by the creator and others. This was
decided on because during the testing phase involving me and others at the our
employing company, we found that when multiple users are working on the same
project, the server get confused as to the structure and state of the projects
causing possible data loss and random movement of reports and files in the
project structure. Today's session was more focused on security and access
configuration. Basically we discussed how to control who can do what and why you
would want to restrict their access. We finished up a bit early today which was
nice because we left late yesterday. Sean also let me know that I don't need to
go to the site tomorrow because it'll mostly just be meetings and he would
rather me get through the report verification.
