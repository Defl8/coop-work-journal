Here it is, the final entry. It's been super fun working at DCD Engineering. I was super sure what to expect from this position at all to start since we hadn't touched PLC related topics in school yet. Maybe I was a bit unsure as to whether I would like the work, but turns out it was a lot more exciting than I thought. PLC and HMI work is interesting and something I am not the most used to. But I'm never against learning new things. This gave me some initial insight into what type of work the standard automation technician does. It felt adjacent to programming and had some cross over so it came pretty naturally when I was doing things. Next, they started moving me to some small but important data science tasks. I made a couple scripts that would do some sort of math operation on chunked data sets like finding slopes or making calculator for dead values, stuff like that.
