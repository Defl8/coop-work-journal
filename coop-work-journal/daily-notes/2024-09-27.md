Well my script in SQL broke. Turns out you need some special permissions to run jobs on the server. Not only did I have a couple typos but I had some standard Transact SQL syntax that wasn't compatible with one of the client stored procedures in my script. I took about half the day but I think I figured out most of the issues with my script and it is now running smoothly. We couldn't figure out how to get the job running without actually running the job under my user so we figure we need SA privilege's for it to work properly.
With that in mind, I fired off and email to IT at our client and wait for a response. I heard one of them is going to be out for jury duty which always great timing. The only issue with this that remains is that we have to backfill data for the polling times that the script missed before. I for the life of me cannot figure why this wasn't working. I change my stored procedure to do the same thing just accept a manual date
