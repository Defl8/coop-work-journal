I drove into the office this morning to find that everything is still in disarray from the renovations that they have been doing while I have been gone. I spent a decent chunk of the morning setting up in my little room kind of like I did when I first started. It was like a scavenger hunt to try and find all of my stuff that was scattered. Luckily, Sean packed all my stuff up for me since I was on site and he made sure he got everything. It took a little bit of looking but I eventually found my box amongst some other boxes and got my setup going again. We had the morning meeting as per usual and we mainly discussed the idea of making the report patches to the non critical data entry reports as the managers have been asking for these and we can finally tackle them since the other main priorities have either been finished or are in a good spot. They did mention data importing as well as this is a big priority for them this week since the managers need to do there month end report. I made the script to generate the import file for manual data import into the AVEVA historian, but the main issue is getting the data itself. We have to manually punch in tags to the old plugin that their old system used in excel since no one at the client who is currently working there knows how it work
