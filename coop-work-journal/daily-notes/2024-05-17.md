# 2024-05-17
Today was more report validation. Sean came into the office today so it was nice to have some company. He did spend most of his day in meetings (which seems to be regular for him). Report validation went smoothly today except for when I would reach reports with upwards of 20 tables. At that point it got a little tedious expanding the excel spreadsheet that I made to accommodate these large group of rows. Still haven't really figured out why some tables on the new system display data when they didn't on the old system, and vice versa. Likely due to some sort of query or source data issue that we haven't solved yet, but will need to solve in the future. In one of Sean's meetings they talked about how since the shutdown we might upgrade all of their systems in place.
