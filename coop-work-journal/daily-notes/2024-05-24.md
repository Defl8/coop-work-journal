Last day of another week. Once again some more report validation. I rounded out verifying all the issues with the reports which means it was time to go through and start fixing them. I started with the easy fixes like formatting or super simple functional changes. This didn't take a lot of time and really minimized the amount of time that I thought this process would take. Then as a break I fiddled around with the engineering units as Sean sent me another list to try and fill out the master list. Unfortunately, there are still a lot of missing ranges, as not all these lists are complete it seems as even manually going through the lists to find the incomplete ranges, they do not appear in any of the files I was given. With that out of the way
