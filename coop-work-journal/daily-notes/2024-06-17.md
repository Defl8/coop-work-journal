Back in the office with a new task for the week. Matt came in and had me setup a
new HMI for editing similar to the last two. This one is also on the same
pipeline as the other just a different site in a different location. This time
I'm no longer editing items that already exist on the HMI, I am now making a
window from scratch. Basically, the site consists of a few tanks that need to
have a sensor because due to re pressurizing the oil along the pipeline, some
gas would buildup in the tanks between the roof and the walls of the tank,
causing a potentially explosive situation if a spark or some ignition source
that could come into contact with the tanks. The window I'm building is meant to
trigger alarms when this type of environment occurs. I've been given a map of
what the site looks like and where each tank and senor are relative to the site.
I'm tasked with reconstructing this in the HMI and making sure that when the gas
environment occurs, the operator is notified by an obvious indicator and can
easily pinpoint which tank and which sensor is being triggered and why. Most of
my day was spent looking and learning how to import and make graphics placing
them and making them look nice, as quality and simplicity is the goal with most
HMIs. Just like everything at this job it's alot to take in at first but I'll
get used to it eventually like everything. I continue tomorrow.
