Today was problematic. First of all report verification was going well. With the information Sean and I uncovered yesterday going through reports was much quicker and easier. There were still a couple problems that I could not resolve, such as data mismatch when all the parameters are correct on both reports. This is likely do to how the data is being queried before even reaching the report. These will likely be harder to trouble shoot down the line as the solution will be more completed than meets the eye. But that was just the start. Later into the afternoon Sean asked me to hop off the server so he could implement the new dev server for the project. They've been wanting to separate the servers so issues with multiple users developing in the software don't arise like before. This great because it allows for versioning of the project as well, so if someone implements something wrong or some update causes the project to break and isn't recoverable from it's current state, we can go back to a previous version and not lose all the data. This is a common form of version control like Git, which is the gold standard when it comes to version control for programming. This software's version control is exactly like Git in the sense of commits which are when you make changes to the project and want to "save" those changes
