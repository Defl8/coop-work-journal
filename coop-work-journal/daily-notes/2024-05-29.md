Today was problematic. First of all report verification was going well. With the information Sean and I uncovered yesterday going through reports was much quicker and easier. There were still a couple problems that I could not resolve, such as data mismatch when all the parameters are correct on both reports. This is likely do to how the data is being queried before even reaching the report. These will likely be harder to trouble shoot down the line
