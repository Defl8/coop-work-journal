Once again, I am chugging through reports. I made it through a couple larger
ones today. Although I initially spent the morning trouble shooting three I
chose to work on since they weren't displaying values. After discussing with
Sean, we decided I should just move on and keep going through the reports and
anything that isn't working we can fix later. Eventually some of the reports I
continued to make did work without me changing anything in my process, which
leads me to believe that it is an issue with the data and not with how I'm
compiling the report. The old reports which use a less efficient table for data
retrieval allows for a footer where the previous report makers have been adding
averages for values displayed in the table currently instead of just making a
new section of the table. I don't / haven't figured out if there is a way to do
this with the table from the template I am using but I figured I would ask Sean
next time I get the chance. There's still a lot to go through so it will likely
be a couple more weeks before all the report transferring gets completed.
