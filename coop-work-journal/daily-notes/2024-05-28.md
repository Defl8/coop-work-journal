Just some more, report verification for today. Except Sean and I did a little bit of a deep dive into some of the tags that are causing us issues. Some of the tags were producing weird results and 0s where there shouldn't be. So, we managed to figure why the initial one was due to a miscalculation involving engineering units. Basically since the engineering units have been messed up from the start, and this is a fundamental way that the AVEVA software calculates specific values, especially flows which are just calculated using integration.
