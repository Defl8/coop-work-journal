Just some more, report verification for today. Except Sean and I did a little bit of a deep dive into some of the tags that are causing us issues. Some of the tags were producing weird results and 0s where there shouldn't be. So, we managed to figure why the initial one was due to a miscalculation involving engineering units. Basically since the engineering units have been messed up from the start, and this is a fundamental way that the AVEVA software calculates specific values, especially flows which are just calculated using integration. This gives wildly different values despite the values actually being logged to be used in the calculation are the same on both sides. A little annoying but not a big issue. Next we came across the fact that the last integrator just copied things over without really checking of fixing anything. This means that an undetermined amount of reports could just have wrong drivers causing the wrong type of data to be displayed in the first place. Again, really annoying but not the worst. But by far the worst thing we came across today is that whoever chose the name for tags did a terrible job. Apparently, there are a bunch of manual entry tags that only point to the old system
