Back to the report grind, it seems a lot of the employers previous reports were
broken due to a variety of reasons like weird data entry.  All in all still
chugging through. This afternoon I mostly worked on a excel sheet that Sean had
made up as a template for quick data retrieval from the database. Basically they
just want a quick reference. It works almost identically to the reports I;ve
been making just in excel instead. This took up pretty much my whole day. Sean
gonna use the excel sheet I compiled in his training sessions tomorrow.
