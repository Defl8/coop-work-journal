Well I was trying to brute force this spreadsheet converter today. I want to make a program that can iterate through the desired sheets to convert and be given a set of find values and replace values. This is not that difficult leveraging the openpyxl module for python. This basically allows file I/O and per sheet, row, column and cell editing of a loaded workbook. My script starts by loading the workbook in. Then we want to get the sheet names in a list and then remove two specific sheets in the list that hold the data and references we want to find and replace.
