Well I was trying to brute force this spreadsheet converter today. I want to make a program that can iterate through the desired sheets to convert and be given a set of find values and replace values. This is not that difficult leveraging the openpyxl module for python. This basically allows file I/O and per sheet, row, column and cell editing of a loaded workbook. My script starts by loading the workbook in. Then we want to get the sheet names in a list and then remove two specific sheets in the list that hold the data and references we want to find and replace. This is done by getting all of the sheets from the workbook, then with the hard coded names of the data sheets we remove those from the sheet list. Then we got to one of the sheets. This sheet already has a row in it storing the values I wanna to find across the whole workbook. It leverages an iter_rows() method which returns a generator of the rows specified in the range of rows it was permitted to go over. In this case it is only one row that comes out of the generator. Then once we have the generator of the single row, we then go over all the cells in the row and then append their values to a list. This list is the list of the find values. Storing that whole procedure in a function we then call the function again except this time to get the replace values which are in the row below the find values on the sheet.
