Back to site. Today might be the last day. Originally it was discussed that we might not do the walk around on Friday because it would be the same crew as crew one. So in theory there probably wouldn't be much new feedback as we would've addressed most of it by now (hopefully). We talked it over in the morning meeting before we would head out.
