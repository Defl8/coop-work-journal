So as I mentioned yesterday, I started building the script today. The library is dead simple if you are trying to do simple mouse and keyboard strokes. Basically the library allows you to identify pixel positions on the screen and move the mouse to then. Then you can either click, perform keystrokes (which can be passed as an iterable, which is nice) and some other standard user like inputs. The main reason I want to use this is mainly to save my wrists from damage from 1000 repetitive motions, copy pasting tag names into the Excel add in. Also another benefit is that there is virtually zero downtime. I guarantee that I would get distracted or inefficient during the long process of copy pasting. The script however, does not experience this fatigue. On a side note, I think alot of the guys here at the office don't really understand how the programs I make do what they do on a fundamental level. At least from what they told me, it seems like I just throw something into the program and I get the desired output. Which is not entirely wrong, I try and write my programs so that they seem like a magic black box that spits the right results given the right input. However, something that sets this script apart is that it is very visually as to what is being accomplished.
