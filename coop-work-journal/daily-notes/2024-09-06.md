The remote support is really ramping up today holy. Pretty much the support is just investigating problems with reports or fixing other minor issues. A bunch of operators are not really familiar with how the Aveva reports works since they are usually against changing their daily workflows and learning a new work to work. So with that in mind the issues that get brought to Sean and I are usually pretty surface level and I can solve them independently. So my days recently have mostly consisted of responding to operators and helping them with achieving what they need to in reports whether that be problems with data showing and inputting comments or trend functionality on the web. Occasionally we get backend problems that Sean usually has to deal with directly since I don't know/have access to the backend
