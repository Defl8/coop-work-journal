Some more report work today and we've hit a breakthrough. Awhile ago, I talked about how different people have been having tags change on their reports in their own instance. This is odd because we tried to prevent this by setting up the remote development feature which also helped with mitigating the project corruption problem we were running into before anyway. The project corruption has been solved but the tag switching has not been resolved. So David, Lane and I did some testing to figure out why this was happening. One thing we noticed is that if some leaves their own instance of report studio open after some one makes changes on a report and they do not close and open their own instance after the changes are made and applied. This we determined is likely because we are not using the remote development feature in the way it was intended to be used. The ideal configuration we suspect is that each user is supposed to have a local version of reports studio on their own pc, that pull the project file from the server which hosts the actual final version of
