More remote support. Sean was not in the office this morning. He texted me saying that he was at Alta steel getting a new client. He told me something crazy, he told me that they are paying for an Aveva license but not even using half the products they are able to. They have a system for the way they make "reports". Basically, he told me that they go into the trend tool which keep in mind is designed for viewing data on a graph, then they dump all the tag data from there into a file, copy paste that into Excel and there is their report. Meanwhile they are paying for the historian add in from aveva which basically allows them to do this while interfacing directly from their Historian setup
