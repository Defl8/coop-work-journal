More remote support. Sean was not in the office this morning. He texted me
saying that he was at Alta steel getting a new client. He told me something
crazy, he told me that they are paying for an Aveva license but not even using
half the products they are able to. They have a system for the way they make
"reports". Basically, he told me that they go into the trend tool which keep in
mind is designed for viewing data on a graph, then they dump all the tag data
from there into a file, copy paste that into Excel and there is their report.
Meanwhile they are paying for the historian add in from Aveva which basically
allows them to do this while interfacing directly from their Historian setup.
Not to mention that reports studio allows them to do in a much more efficient
manor where you can just make the report and then have on the file data being
pulled with different time steps and such. So I have no idea if I'll be put on
this project or work with this client at all but I imagine that I will be at
some point because it seems very reminiscent of our current project that we are
providing support for. That on top of another upcoming similar reports style
project. Overall lot's of things to keep me busy till the end of my coop
position. It's kind of crazy how September is the fifth month that I've been
here, and I've definitely learned a lot so far. I continue tomorrow.
