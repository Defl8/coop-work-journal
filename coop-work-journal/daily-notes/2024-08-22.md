# 2024-08-22
More script development today with a focus on data visualization. I spent the morning going through the matplotlib documentation and API reference with the intention of learning some more about the functionality and syntax for making visualizations since the code from the old dev is all over the place with no comments so it's hard to figure out what does what for which visualization in the program. I did end up learning quite a bit about the base plotting functionality of the library if it weren't integrated with a GUI. Turns out there is a specific section of the API directly meant to integrate within the GUI software I'm using. It just makes the integration of the visualization onto the GUI more seamless while still following the same design philosophy in terms of programming. There are some quirks that I don't really know how to deal with yet. Since the data I'm looking at has two Y axes for each set of data, I managed to get two Y axes on the graph but the scaling for the second one is a little weird and I'm not sure why. The y scale for the first set of data is scaling fine but the y axis for the second isn't scaling at all which is odd since both lines of data are getting drawn.  fjfjjfjfjj
