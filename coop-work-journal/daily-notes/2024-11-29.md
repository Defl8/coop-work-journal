Friday finally, and we start with the regular morning meeting with the client. They are very happy with the turnaround on the data importing since Sean and I essentially got it finished in a day. Sean told me that he ended up splitting the files up into smaller sheet since the import tool did not like receiving 500000 rows in a single sheet to be imported all at once. He sent me some of the errors he was getting and they mostly seemed like errors of too much data or single tags having weird data, which lead him to split the files up. He told me when he tried with one of the split up files, it worked flawlessly. We eliminated the possibility that the script I wrote to generate the import file was wrong since we did a fair amount of testing with smaller datasets before doing the actual data import just to make sure that the generated import file was valid. This is another reason we figured that the size of the import file was too big. So after splitting the file up a ton, the data all eventually made it into the historian. We let the client know that if any spot data is missing to let us know because it is entirely possible we missed something since the dataset was so big. So far we haven't heard anything about any missing data that anyone is using. However, the data import is still fresh.
