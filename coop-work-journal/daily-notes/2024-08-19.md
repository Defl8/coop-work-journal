Just more script development today. I think I've gotten pretty much all the functionality of the main page working today. That is the page that takes in data. I'm basically using the main class where the application runs to hold all the data I need from this page. Essentially every input that is given by the user get stored as a private attribute in the class and is then accessed as a property using the property decorator in Python. This basically allows you to get and set a private attribute of a class instance while treating it like a regular attribute. I'll give an example below. (The example is done is markdown which you can see on the github where have this whole work journal stored).
```Python
class Car:
	def __init_(self, brand, model, year):
		self.__brand = brand
		self.__model = model
		self.__year = year

	@property
	def year(self):
		return self.__year

	@year.setter
	def year(self, value):
		self.__year = value

car = Car("bmw", "x5", 2015)
car.year
# car.year returns 2015

car.year = 2021 
# car.year returns 2021 now
```
This is just a more convenient way to access the values of private attributes and promotes code safety while still having access to values stored in the class instance. I've been using it a lot as it makes code safer and cleaner in my opinion. It also avoids having to call the getters and setters as actual methods individually. Plus you can add code to modify the value given to fit the attribute better if necessary. Later today Rod talked to me about s
