More report verification. Initially I was dreading the fact that I was eventually going to have to tackle a very large report with around 45 tables. However, once I started going through each of the table today I found that the changes were actually very minor. First of all, a lot of the tags for the tables that weren't working where manual entry which makes sense why they weren't working. A nice and simple note about that on the spreadsheet and then the changes are fixed and made. The other big issue I ran into was when I was initially reviewing the reports, I must've missed the fact that the time range for the report was different then the one on the old system, hence mismatched values when I was comparing the output of the new report.
