More report verification. Initially I was dreading the fact that I was eventually going to have to tackle a very large report with around 45 tables. However, once I started going through each of the table today I found that the changes were actually very minor. First of all, a lot of the tags for the tables that weren't working where manual entry which makes sense why they weren't working. A nice and simple note about that on the spreadsheet and then the changes are xed and made. The other big issue I ran into was when I was initially reviewing the reports, I must've missed the fact that the time range for the report was different then the one on the old system, hence mismatched values when I was comparing the output of the new report. This made the bulk verification of multiple tables extremely easy, as it was glance at the table, check if it's wrong, if not great, else dig deeper. I'm nearing the end of the verification now so hopefully not too much longer. I also heard the higher ups discussing about moving me to some new other stuff so I get a little more hands with actual PLC programming and related technologies.
