# 2024-11-07
Not a very eventful Thursday. Gearing up to celebrate Luke at the office's ten year anniversary at the company. I haven't talked a whole lot with him but he is one of the people that is here as early as me and Jeff. But today was another slow day. Until later in the day Sean and I got a message from Jodi asking if I would be available to do on site support starting sometime next week. They haven't given us a definitive schedule, so some stuff is still up in the air but it seems like it will happen this time around since their day for shutting down their old system seems to be set in stone.
