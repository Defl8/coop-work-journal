Back at the office and actually staying. Yay! Ryan sent me a message last night saying that he swapped the the ethernet cables in Sean and office and said it should be good for me to come back in. That made me excited cause quite honestly I don't like working at home. I think my mind is pretty black and white when it comes to work life balance. I like the office because it is the isolated place where I do work and I like home because that's my signal that I'm on my own time. The isolation really makes me more productive at the office anyway.
