It's a remote support type of day. I've basically just been doing some standard remote support stuff for our client that is switching over there system and needs some help making sure that it at least goes semi smoothly. The big discussion involving me today was how to organize the trends in the web client since they haven't been organized yet. These are the same web trends that I imported a while ago using a script I developed awhile ago. The main reason I made the script in the first place was to import a large amount of trends from local files to the web client since Aveva has no native way of doing this. There was almost five hundred trends that needed to be imported and you bet that I'm gonna try and find a way to automate the process instead of wasting a whole work week remaking things that are already made. So with that in mind, I made the script in about a day, did half a day of testing and then began transferring the reports. The script pretty much just remade the JSON that the web client would push to the SQL table that housed all the web trend data. My script just takes the local file which is basically just an xml file that has data for the layout of the trend in it. So the script just looks at the xml for the tag names for the trend and then builds the json, encodes it then inserts it into the SQL table.
