Almost done report verification!! It been a long time coming but I'm almost through all of the values matching and afterwards it some easy cosmetic cleanup and then the reports should be ready to be pushed to production for the trained users to access. This is pretty much what I've been working on since I started at the company so it's nice to see the effort pay off with compliments from the company that employed us. But more than anything, I'm excited to maybe move to something new as I have been working on this for a while and there isn't much thought involved once you understand the core functionality of the different programs. The office is pretty empty today a lot of the people I'm used to seeing don't seem to be around today and I don't really know why but maybe they are just working from as others seem to do. I personally prefer being in the office as it switches me into the working mindset, much like school. Although, I think it could be nice to work from home every once and awhile if I really don't feel like going into the office. But I'm not sure I can as for that just yet. Tomorrow, hopefully can wrap up report verification.
