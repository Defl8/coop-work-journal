Just some more remote support today. I started off by asking one of the clients if they needed anything done in particular. They mentioned that some of the reports need a sum or average total at the bottom of their tables and they are following a specific procedure to implement these. They use single data objects in a simple table that are linked to specific tags and use the built in statistical function manager to get the values we are lookin for. There are a bunch of reports that need these additions. We knew this initially when we were first transferring the reports over to the reports app, but we decided to ignore them, since we were not sure if we actually needed them or not. Low and behold they were needed after all. So my main job was to go through these while handling anything Sean threw my way.
