More excel stuff after the long weekend but some progress has been made. I came up with the idea that I give each of the columns in the original data set a number. This number represents their positions from the data from the original system. My original idea was to organize the data by retrieval method with the order number previously assigned at the end of the queried data. Then revert back to the original data order so that I can simply replace the sheet name of the old data with the sheet name of the new data and have the data still be accurate. Sean is very up for this idea except for one part. He mentioned that reverting the sorted data won't work. This is because the way the historian plug in for Excel works is it uses an array formula that makes and API request.
