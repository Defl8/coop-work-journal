Back to the grind. A little different stuff happened today I did some report stuff in the morning. And then I got my other set of credentials for the client with Rod to be able to access all the sites that have data that get transferred up to their central data server. This was a time and a half, I had to get credentials to be able to get onto the cloud pc that was created for me. Then I needed credentials to be able to get onto the jump box that allows to access to jump again to the secure zone where on there I have remote connection manager to access all the different sites in one program. This is a lot of hoops to jump through not to mention that these credentials are not permanent and get cleared every 8 weeks. Luckily this will only happen to me once since I am only at the company for another 3 ish months.
