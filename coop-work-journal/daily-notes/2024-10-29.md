We are getting close to the end now. I turned in my spreadsheets to Jodi so that they may be able to be tested by the those who are responsible for them and those that use them every day. This is a huge load off me especially since we determined that the function used in the worksheet, we are not responsible for. Therefore if the data conversion breaks the spreadsheet it is not on the converters to be able to fix the functions, that will be up to the end user. The way we figured the way to do this was actually smart of Leon. He recommended that we do not try and update all the cell references which is a huge breaking point for the sheets, which is what I was trying to do. He then suggested making a copy of the original data sheet just so that things are maintained at the old data can be referenced if necessary. Then he said make a new sheet to map the tags with the new AVEVA system tags which is really simple since we have a lookup sheet and can use a simple XLOOKUP formula to find the AVEVA equivalents of the KM tags. Then query the data and make sure the data lines up between the systems, if some of the tag data doesn't line up it needs to be mentioned or rationalized as to why the data is different. Most of the time it usually retrieval method differences on accident or the AVEVA data is actually more accurate since recently
