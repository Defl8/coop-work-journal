Continuing on with the work from yesterday, I'm making steady progress on my
window slowly but surely. I did a little more development in the sense of
placing the sensor on the graphic. The sensors are a custom made graphic I made
that replicated an image I was given of them. These got labels for the sensors
names and antenna names. The tank graphics also got a label, I also switched out
the alarm graphic for a more compact one to fit in the tank graphic. Matt gave
me some feedback and told me to update a few things but he said I was on the
right track, he also gave me an email with some name updates for the labels.
Around lunch I had a meeting with Sean and the employer for the company we were
update reports for. He wants me to go through the manual entry reports he made
and make sure the formatting looks good, a small task compared to the last time
I did verification for the entire database. This is pretty much what I did for
the remainder of the day. Matt told me to prioritize doing the work for this
company as it is much closer to a deadline than the graphic I was working on. I
continue on tomorrow with verification.
