# 2024-10-25
It's Friday! Still work to do. I kept going through my spreadsheet and making notes where applicable. I wrapped this up pretty quick because the the list of potential issues with the data difference is quite small so identifying the discrepancy between the data was easy and quick. Then I had Lane messaging me again to make some changes to his reports due to his fear of conflicts of him working in report studio at the same time as me. This has been pretty much how my days have been going as of late. Not a whole lot going on as I keep making small changes to reports and asking the testers to keep testing their stuff. I am leaving the spreadsheet I am responsible for till next week as Sean mentioned that we could both crackdown and work on them together as he has one he need to convert as well.
