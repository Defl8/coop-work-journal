More remote support today and some pretty general stuff nothing too crazy. I had a talk with Rod today about where the work I'm doing for him is going. Basically the project is supposed to finish this month and he doesn't really know how it is going to go forward from here on. He told me that the higher ups don't really seem like they have plan or even really an idea on how to proceed/care to proceed. So the script thing I'm doing is kinda in limbo because if they decide not to pay us to do sustainment then the project is just kind of over and we don't really know how or when that could happen. Rod made it seem like they don't really the complexity of how the data transfer works and only have a high level view of how things go
