Back at the client site again. Friday today so it'll be nice to have the weekend to recooperate. Today pretty much followed the same structure as yesterday. David, Leon and I took care of our respective control rooms and we received mostly the same feedback. One new piece which was interesting was that some of the operators requested less harsh colored versions of the reports they used. They said that the current color scheme is a little harsh on the eyes especially when working on it late at night. Which is fair since the operators do 12 hour shifts. So Leon made a grey version of the reports that that control room used daily. Not much other feedback. Something else new is that more people are requesting a print button or a printable version of the report that they use. Some of the reports need to be printed at the end of every shift, mainly the ones used for environmental tracking as these are basically needed to allow the plant to run. Leon mentioned that there is likely an option in the same style button we use to allow operators to submit manual entries might have it a print function. Otherwise we'd have to find some other work around.ff
