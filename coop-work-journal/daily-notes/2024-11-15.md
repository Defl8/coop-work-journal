Back at the client site again. Friday today so it'll be nice to have the weekend to recooperate. Today pretty much followed the same structure as yesterday. David, Leon and I took care of our respective control rooms and we received mostly the same feedback. One new piece which was interesting was that some of the operators requested less harsh colored versions of the reports they used. They said that the current color scheme is a little harsh on the eyes especially when working on it late at night.
