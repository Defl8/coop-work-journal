Tuned in to another one of Sean's training sessions. This one was a bit of a
slog, 4 hours long total. However this session was with a new group of people
and this group is much more engaged then the previous. They were asking
questions following along well which made the 4 hours pass a bit quicker. I
mostly continued with reports during this time so the meeting served as
background noise. Initially the company who employed us wanted this new data
system to go live at the end of May to the beginning of June. However, the lead
on this project at our employer said that the yearly shutdown they do in
September may be moved to June instead. This would give us a little more time to
flesh out the system and polish some aspects. We are still operating as if the
timeline is the same but will take advantage of the extra time if the decision
to change the shutdown ends up getting made. Afterwards, I was also in another
of Sean's training session but this one was only an hour. It was mostly showing
off the trend viewer client app, query tool and excel template that I made
yesterday. This session went well too and Sean got a lot of positive feedback
which he appreciated.
