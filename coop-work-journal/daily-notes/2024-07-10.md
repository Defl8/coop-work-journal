Today I continue building out my list of trends to make. However in a turn of events this took longer than expected. Theres was lots of trends I built out and they feel like they just keep on coming. Not much to say about these but basically I just look up the tags and replicate them on the web portal. Sean and I did some troubleshooting though for the reports server. There were some networking or license issues cause the upgrade to go badly. We spent quite a few hours going through the console log and trying to figure out how the we could potentially fix everything that broke in the upgrade.
