Today I continue building out my list of trends to make. However in a turn of events this took longer than expected. There's was lots of trends I built out and they feel like they just keep on coming. Not much to say about these but basically I just look up the tags and replicate them on the web portal. Sean and I did some troubleshooting though for the reports server. There were some networking or license issues cause the upgrade to go badly. We spent quite a few hours going through the console log and trying to figure out how the we could potentially fix everything that broke in the upgrade. We didn't completely fix it but we did manage to get reports working again and it loads a lot faster than it did before for some reason. We were on the call with IT from the company pretty much all day trying to figure it out. I continue tomorrow.
