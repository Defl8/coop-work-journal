I started working a little more on the sump analyzer this morning. Matt sent me the document with the formula used to calculate the slope given the data set. The formula is the least squares regression formula. This allows use to get the slope of the best fit line for the data points and can then be used to calculate the error percentage of those points relative to the best fit line. It took me awhile to be able to understand the data and interpret how it actually worked and apply that to the formula. I have a general idea of how I can do this with code. This is where the pandas library really comes in handy since it allows for series vectorization which just allows me to apply operations to whole data set instead of individual values in the series. This should be pretty easy to do in my eyes assuming I account for the data type of the data being consistent and the operations being good. Otherwise I've just been doing more remote support. I tried to find some documentation for the report system to see if we could change the default no value message which is just N/A. This has been something they have wanted to change since I started working at the company. I tried to see if we could make some SQL statement when the data gets pulled, intercepting the spots where there is no data and then
