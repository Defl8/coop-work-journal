I started working a little more on the sump analyzer this morning. Matt sent me the document with the formula used to calculate the slope given the data set. The formula is the least squares regression formula. This allows use to get the slope of the best fit line for the data points and can then be used to calculate the error percentage of those points relative to the best fit line. It took me awhile to be able to understand the data and interpret how it actually worked and apply that to the formula.
