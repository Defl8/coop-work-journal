More testing today.  I made some improvements to the HMI in terms of adding
popups for the repeaters and making minor adjustments. Then I just continued
flipping bits in the software that allows to program the physical PLC. It's kind
of fun flipping the bits and seeing the effort I put into the HMI work with the
alarms and system reflecting my inputs. I made some checklists in obsidian that
I want to use to keep track of which alarms I have tested and which are working
or need to be change in some way. The PLC I'm specifically working with is made
by General Electric and use functional block style programming. Basically all
the PLC tags are used as sources and inputs and are fed into blocks on the
program design and then certain outputs can be achieved. For example, all the
basic logic gates are present in functional block programs, this include OR and
AND gates but also all the others you might be familiar with. These actually
look really similar to Multisim and familiar software from school. The inputs
and outputs of each functional block are labeled much of the same way as that
the multisim components are labeled. This makes the software feel alot less
intimidating. It been fun figuring out how things work and seeing everything
come together in a nice package, which is why I enjoy programming related things
ultimately. I continue tomorrow.
