More testing today.  I made some improvements to the HMI in terms of adding popups for the repeaters and making minor adjustements. Then I just continued flipping bits in the software that allows to program the physical PLC. It's kind of fun flipping the bits and seeing the effort I put into the HMI work with the alarms and system reflecting my inputs.
