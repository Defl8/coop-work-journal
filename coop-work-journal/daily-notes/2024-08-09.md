Got in early to the office today. Sean gave me the spreadsheet to do again since he now got approval to make a script for it that will do all the necessary conversion we need to make it work across pretty much all the sheets that need to be updated.  Luckily the script is able to be written in TypeScript (a language processor for JavaScript) which basically allows you to have type hints in JavaScript. Everything is going pretty well basically I am making lists with the parameters I need for each tag and then making an object for that tag. This allows all the values need to be stored in one spot instead of across multiple data structures.
