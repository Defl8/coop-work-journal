Well another week, the client still seems pretty happy with how we are doing although some of the reports have fallen behind. The shift supervisor report I am responsible for is the one that has fallen behind the other one passed last week. This one know has the one tag fixed but now another two are acting up. So, Sean and I did some investigating and we found out that the numbers that KM was showing were incorrect. We called up Alex the tester for the report. Sean explained to him the situation and why we think the KM values are wrong. Basically the tag is tracking cycles ran. It updates on the hour and check how many cycles have passed and then reports that. the KM made no sense though for the time period. It was displaying 9 for the first shift and 1 for the second shift. The nine can make sense but the 1 doesn't since the cycles reset after 17 meaning that there is no way after that length of time the cycles could only be one. Now that the tag is fixed on the AVEVA report it shows 8 and 8 for both values. Which is correct given the way the tag is intended to work. So after this fix I implemented the fix for the other one into the molar ratio table as per Sean. This fixed both of tags and should allow the leach shift supervisor report to be updated.
