Some more development today. I managed to get the combo boxes working super nice. The other thing I wanted to tackle was the auto filing of the input boxes with the ranges. I want the script to auto analyze the the max in min values in the data then fill the appropriate input boxes with the correct ranges automatically. This is kinda of what I think would be nice quality of life improvement. I am trying to think of other things like this that would make the program alot nicer to use then the current program. This would make it especially more user friendly. This has pretty much been my day to day. Not a lot of features implemented today anyway just smoothing out the ones I have already implemented. My improvement
