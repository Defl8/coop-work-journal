I pretty much only did script development today. It's taking me a bit to get a grasp on how batch script actually works and the syntax is probably the most difficult part. I was able to get the script to a point where it can recognize whether the specified file to indicate that it needs to transfer or recognize that there are files in the directory. The hard part I have been brainstorming about is how to recognize if the file is an hour old. Since there isn't even really types in batch scripting it makes a little difficult to deal with dates since there isn't objects to handle more complex things like dates, which can vary in syntax drastically. So basically my general idea is to get the timestamp of the latest file, isolate the time from the date and then express it in seconds and find out if the difference is greater than an hour. The way I thought to do this see if the file time is greater than the system time which would indicate that the file is from an earlier day since that is the only situation where the file time would be greater than the system time. If this is the case then we can subtract the sys time from the file time and if the result is less than -1 then we know it is at least an hour old compared to the system time when the script runs.
