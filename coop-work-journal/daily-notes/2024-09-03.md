More support today, mostly. I kept going through the reports in the list and adding the missing statistical function tables that the operators have requested. This again isn't the most interesting task but very chill and nice when I don't have a lot of brain power on the first day of the week. Other than that I chatted with Rod today about some work I could do for one of his clients. Basically they need some scripts developed to transfer data between a bunch of different sites to one central SQL server.
