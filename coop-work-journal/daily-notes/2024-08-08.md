Not a whole lot happened today. I helped Sean with some stuff this morning that he did for Enbridge. He has a meeting with them today to try and pitch something to them. Don't remember what is was though. I worked on updating the trend import script I made. Sean wants it to be able to take in a list of tags along with .aaTrend files. This for an upcoming client that has a similar project to the company I started work with when I got hired here. Later I talked with Rod who said he had some stuff I could do awhile ago. Basically we need to build out documentation for users at a site who manually import data so that they can basically give it to anyone and they can replicate the process pretty easily. He also told me there may be some scripting that needs to be used because they are having issues with their current script not deleting files on the host machine after sending them over to the server.
