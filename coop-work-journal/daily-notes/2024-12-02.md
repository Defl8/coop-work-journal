Pretty quiet here today, I did some report patching for the client as that seems to be all that is left for the major things, otherwise radio silence from them. Sean said he isn't feeling too well today so he won't be coming/won't be very active on teams. I asked Kieran about ignition today. Ignition is a modern (at least it seems more modern) HMI SCADA interfacing software. The cool part about it is that the personal license is free and the software is free so you can use it at home to make HMI's and stuff. This would be pretty cool to make a homeade interface for something like a raspberry pi dashboard. The main two reasons I was interested in it was they encourage running the instance in docker containers, which is super cool and virtually eliminates cross platform incompatibilities. Also the scripting language is done in Jython which is a version of Python 2.7 implemented entirely in Java. So instead of using their own proprietary scripting language like most other pieces of HMI and SCADA software use, this one uses something I am familiar with anyway, not to mention that that version of Python has a lot of documentation since it is a bit older.
