More script development today. I cleaned up some of my code for the data tab. The original program lacks a lot of polish in terms of error handling. One of the first things I noticed when launching the console spits out a bunch of errors but somehow still manages to run. To be fair there is a fair amount of unfinished and unimplemented code that could be causing these but my point still stands. If anything this code should be commented out, removed or fixed, which is a big part of why I wanted to start this from the ground up again. Not to mention that the code is very disorganized and has some questionable choices made about its structure and procedures. For example the base program lack error handling for the most part and if it did have some sort of error handling the program wouldn't notify the user at all that they had triggered an error and something would have to be changed whether it be about their input or about the data they loaded into the program.
