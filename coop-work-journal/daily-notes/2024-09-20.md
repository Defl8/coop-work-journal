Well I worked on the analyzer again this morning. I tried to build my own thing to handle the calculations but I think my lack of understanding didn't really help so asked Matt some questions that helped me interpret the data a little more. Turns out for the calculation the time stamp doesn't really matter since what I needed to know was that the data is polled every ten seconds which is what is actually used in the calculation. After the calculation I think I need to calculate the error percentage of each point and find those where they are at varying percent 5 or above. This should be pretty simple once the actual formula is actually completed. In other report news we found the option. I mentioned last time that we wanted to find a way to change the no data message and we finally found it. It is under the project settings but we have looked there before, but we didn't think to look for it under the localization tab, which to me implies that it is time related or something
