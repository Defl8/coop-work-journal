More script development today. We are getting somewhere, but today was kind of a wash. I came into the office and had no internet. I just assumed that it was an office related hardware issue. However it proved to be much worse. Turns out some construction project in the local area had taken out the internet by accidentally cutting one of the fibre lines provided by Shaw.
