Some good progress this morning. As I mentioned previously I was going to beef up the documentation for the sump analyzer script. This took sometime but I got it done pretty quick in the morning. I wanted to lay it out as if the documentation was explaining how to use the program from the perspective of someone who has never seen code before. That's what I have liked about using Jupyter Notebooks is that I can have pretty documentation in markdown which has support for stuff like code blocks and LaTeX formatting for fancy symbols like formulas. This allows for a nice single file that contains runnable code
