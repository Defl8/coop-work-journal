More report support. I also spent a chunk of the day trying to get my account for a client. This is the same as the one I was writing the script for. I haven't been able to do much for the client since I've been busy with the client I was given when I started my coop. But I did manage to at least start sorting out my credentials. It is weird how I had to do it though. I had to first call IT which is weird because I figured it would just be sent to me via Rod or my email. But no that would be too simple. Then I got on the phone with someone from support and they told I need a badge number which I was not given or told about. So Rod emailed someone for me and the next day I got my badge number. Then after about an hour long call I then got to someone and then talked with them for a bit and explained the situation I was in not being able to access my account and all. They then got me to try and tried to help me reset my password and that didn't work so they escalated me to the next level of support. So then I was on hold for another half hour and then finally someone picked up and helped me out they were super nice.
