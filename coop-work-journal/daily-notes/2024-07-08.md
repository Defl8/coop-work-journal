Today wasn't super interesting. I just did some general office stuff again. Sean was in today he got approval to buy a new monitor. It's a 43 inch monitor that's basically like 4 24inch monitors in a 2x2 configuration. It's what he has at home and describing the reason he needed it to Matt was he would be in the office more often. This is beneficial for Matt cause I think he prefers having people in the office in general. Good for me to because it's nice to have some company instead of sitting alone all day.  Other than that, I spent pretty much all day trying to figure out some issues the reports server for our employer. They did an upgrade last friday and managed to break everything due to numerous different issues. One of the big ones is apparently the port the history one runs on changes by default in the newer version causing a bunch of networking issues. Luckily this one is easily resolved. The other one we spent trouble shooting is it seems that we can't connect to the web portal where all the reports are being hosted
