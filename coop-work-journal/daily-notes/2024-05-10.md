This morning lead off with an advanced report training. This initial group was less interesting than yesterdays. They did not interact as much as the last group. This session basically just covered charts in the report studio. The charts are similar to Excel charts but with a little more convoluted features. This training went smoothly for the most part, sometimes the report studio has errors when you try and make object near the edge of the report page causes you to use some less than convenient work arounds. New to this training session, Sean actually let me teach the report template section. I was nervous at first but eventually just focused on doing a good job and forgot about being nervous. Post training meeting both the lead at the company employing us and Sean complimented how clear and thorough I was explaining the report template features, which made me feel a lot more confident in my ability. Then for the rest of the day I worked on fleshing out the engineering unit standardization I was working on yesterday and finished up the document and gave it to Sean. Researching symbols and standards for units made me realize how inconsistent they can be sometimes despite having a standard. Regardless I finish out the last hour of the day by doing some more reports and heading home for the weekend.
