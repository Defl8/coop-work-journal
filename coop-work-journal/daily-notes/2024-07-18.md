Another day of template file updates. This is where I kinda have a gripe with the difference in certain teams here. Basically the two different teams here like to develop HMI's slightly differently. The Gas team likes to build the windows in System Platform where they are treated as one single graphic with interactable parts. This means that all there objects and tags are defined within the System Platform. This makes for super easy object management with less features for visual customization. On the other hand, the liquids team uses InTouch which is a piece of software specifically designed for making HMI windows and liking tags to object in the HMI windows. This is still hosted through a System Platform Galaxy but all of the tag info and structure in contained within the InTouch application.
