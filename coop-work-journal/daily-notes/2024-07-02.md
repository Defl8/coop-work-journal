Back to work after a nice long weekend. I finished off the task Sean gave me last week which involved developing out the LIMS tag retrieval methods. I realized I don't actually know what LIMS means, not that it matters. Basically, these tags are used to reference data that has been sampled by the labs at the company. These samples are usually entered manually and don't have a regular data recording schedule. This causes some weird behaviors when pulling data from other tags in the same table. This mostly an issue with aveva reports not knowing how to handle blank data points and usually just choosing to error instead.
