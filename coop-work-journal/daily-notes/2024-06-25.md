Today Matt help me setup the testing VM which will actually let me control the status of certain alarms for the LEL detectors. Basically the software lets you change specific bits that the plc uses to communicate to the HMI. These bits are signals that are received from the site controls which tells the plc to flip certain bits that represent the signals being sent. These are reflected on the HMI by animations performed by graphics that represent these bit states in a meaningful way. For example, say a certain measurement that the control takes is out of range, the control then sends a signal to the PLC, the PLC is then able to interpret this signal and identify what control its from and what the signal means. These are then given names in the PLC software pertaining to the signal they represent. Then this name (referred to as a tag) is then used in the HMI, being assigned to graphics via properties or a script the cause a color change or animation to play based on the current tag state. This is the basic functionality of the whole system. The HMI is in the same vein as front end web development. Placing elements and styling them to make them look nice.
