# 2024-10-09
Well more report work. I am focusing on the super massive reports we have to build since those will definitely be the most time consuming despite them being the last reports that are due. There are other reports that could be worked on but we have all been assigned responsibility over a few and are in charge of ensuring that those are passed by the testers by the time the due date rolls around. Most of mine are waiting on Sean to fix some miscalculated tags but otherwise they are in good shape. This is why I am mostly working the big reports. With the Nov 15 due date in mind, that means I probably won't be able to do any work for Rod until then. It is nice to have a clear timeline. There was a couple of weeks where I didn't really have a timeline for anything and just worked leisurely which I don't really like because I really enjoy being able to mark things off and see things as actually finished. A lot of satisfaction comes from that for me especially when it is work related. Matt still hasn't come by to see my sump analyzer thing that I built but I hope he does. I'm pretty proud of it since moving it to a nicer looking Jupyter Notebook.
