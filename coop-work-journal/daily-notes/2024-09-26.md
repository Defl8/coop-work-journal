Did some sump script development today. So despite the solution of paring down data I still cannot find a way to get this thing to run as fast as I want it to. Going through that much data just seems to be hitting the technical limit of the language and not being able to handle that much processing. I even came up with a little bit of a multiprocessing functionality to try and run some of the data in parallel with the the other so that it would hopefully speed up. This still isn't good enough though as the data takes too long to process. I tried experimenting with various ways to optimize the script but nothing seems to increase the data processing speed at the rate I want to make it more user friendly. Currently I can't really find any useful resources
