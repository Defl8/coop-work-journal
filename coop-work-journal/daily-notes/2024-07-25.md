Finally managed to wrap up template updates today. It did take all day but I'm finally free from the spreadsheet hell. I was told that Cushing is one of the biggest sites and that it should be the last recipe template file that needs to be updated this year. Not really sure what's in the pipeline for me. I did manage to get my site visit organized though which is kind of exciting. So far the company hasn't really given me any indication that I'm doing bad work of any kind so I think that's a good sign. On the other hand I'm not really sure that I'm doing good work either, I like to think that I am though. Either way I can't wait for something new after doing that massive spreadsheet. Friday tomorrow!
