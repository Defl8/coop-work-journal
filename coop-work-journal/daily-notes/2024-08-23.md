Today was mostly learning more about matplotlib to better make the program I am developing. I haven't ultimately solved my final issue which is the weird secondary y axis not scaling to the data unlike the primary y axis which had no issues at all once I gave it the data. I watched a couple videos but I couldn't really find any that used two y axis so It wasn't much help but I got some insight into how to do things a lot better than my spaghetti looking handling of visualizations so it wasn't all for nothing. However later in the day Sean and I both received an interesting email from the client I started working with basically as soon as I started my coop term. This company is now pretty much ready to remove their old system and move over to their new Aveva System that Sean and I both helped integrate. In light of this they want to have someone on sight at their plant for a 12pm to 8pm shift so that if any issues occur then
