Today I was given work that took up the whole day. First Shane from the liquids team came over and showed what I would be doing. Basically the template file is a file they use as a base for the HMI's for this particular customer since their sites are all very similar with minor differences across them. However, they follow a particular pattern when they make these windows. They try and make the comments of each tag related to the symbol in the they are for. However for these older HMIs, this is not the case. So basically my task is to go through all the database dump tags for the HMI and update there comments with the name of the graphic they are attached, their contextual to be specific. There are quite a few tags in the windows I was doing this for so this took up most of the day. Simple task but that's what I'm here for. Then Sean came back into the office after his training and we both got to work with his client. Basically I just had to make more trends on the web client. Then compile the trends into their respective dashboards. This should also keep me occupied
