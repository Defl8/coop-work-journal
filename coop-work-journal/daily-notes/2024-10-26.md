Some more report changes today. Still waiting on testers so they are taking their sweet time. The spreadsheets are the big thing to tackle this week. The issue I'm still running into is whether or not I am responsible for make sure the entire functionality of the spreadsheet is necessary when converting. This drastically changes how I approach the conversion of spreadsheets. I also have Sean to convert so this would be good to know as well before I start with his. I did go through and make all the data comparisons mentioned before. Sean and I organized some time this afternoon to go through our spreadsheet data and making sure that the data lines up or makes sense as to why there is a difference. Some of the tags actually have a pretty big discrepancy but according to Sean this because the old system the client was using.
