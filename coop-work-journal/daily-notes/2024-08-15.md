More script development today. My main goal for today was to get the table view to take the data from a csv file and display in a table format to be viewed. Before I got there though I had to do some GUI configuration figured out. I had to go through the code of the old program and kinda figure out how they made up their GUI. One thing I missed is it seems as though Qt Creator (which is the software the old dev used to build the GUI) has layout object to organize controls on the GUI. This is kind of annoying coming from a C# windows forms app programming standpoint which has a really nice GUI configurator in my opinion. So nice in fact I've been thinking about pitching to Matt about moving this program to C#. My reasons for this are that the GUI designer is much nicer and easier to use. Plus I have a lot more experience with GUIs in general with C# then Python. In fact, I almost prefer to use C# when it comes to GUIs since I just prefer the configurator in general. Using C# would also make the program faster in some cases and have a more familiar feeling with most users here at the office since all machines are Windows machines, spare a couple servers. Obviously I would need to figure how to do the same style data manipulation that the ever useful pandas library does in Python except with C# but I'm sure that it wouldn't be that bad and I could figure it out.
