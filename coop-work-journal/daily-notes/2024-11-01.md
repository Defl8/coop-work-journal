# 2024-11-01
Wrapping up some more report work. We are in a pretty good spot I think. I only
have two reports left and I hope to have those finished today or early next
week. The biggest bottle neck right now is still this specific set of tags that
we have no idea where they are from. These tags are crucial for a lot of metals
related reports as they have a bunch data inputted by a satellite lab. Sean has
a couple meetings with the client to try and figure out where these tags come
from and whether they are needed and the quality of the data. My other report
that needs a fix is probably able to be passed. We are just waiting on one of
the testers. That is also still a big bottleneck for us. The testers are
typically supervisors at the client meaning they are quite busy with their
regular responsibilities, and now they have this verification on their plate. So
alot of them do not have all the time in the world to continually test stuff
delaying the project further. We are running into the same thing with the
spreadsheets. The two I have submitted I have not hear about since I submitted
them. This again delays the project but also the reports are more important than
the sheets. For now we keep chipping away and dealing with what comes our way.
Till next week.
