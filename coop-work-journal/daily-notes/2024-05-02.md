Today, Sean was in office but he was on a call with a site that had a server failure so he spent alot of time working with them to get there server back in working order. He had me read some material about the historian software I'd be using to add reports from a different software so that the company that employed us could stop using it. In a nutshell the software is just making SQL queries from a database and displaying them nicely in a similar way to Excel. Afterwards we figured out how much access I actually had on the remote server housing the data I would need to access.
