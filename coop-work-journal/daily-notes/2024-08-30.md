More remote support today. I spent most of the day going through the report testing spreadsheet seeing which reports needed update and additions. As I mentioned before, I'm going through all reports that need a sum or average row at the bottom of their data tables. These are used by operators to get a quick idea if the they are hitting the right daily averages and can quickly identify potential process issues. This is pretty easy to implement in the reports it just takes a little while since you have to do it for every column of data in the table, so if there's a lot of data on the report then it can take awhile. But I don't mind doing this style of work every once in awhile because it's pretty chill and doesn't take a whole lot thought
