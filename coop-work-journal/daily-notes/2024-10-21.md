Some more general stuff today. We had our now regular check in meeting for reports to make sure everything is going smoothly. Basically all it was was me saying that I am just waiting on responses from the testers before I can continue my work. With that out of the way I started working on my spreadsheet and chipping away at it. I got on a call with David today to get access to the excel over there secure remote desktop software. I need that version of excel since it has the plugin from their old system in it. The reason I need access to their old system is because I need data for the tags that I am trying to convert.
