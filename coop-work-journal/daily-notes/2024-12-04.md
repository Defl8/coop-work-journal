# 2024-12-04
Back to the grind, a little more work from the client today. Passively doing report patches, although it is a little difficult given that the business doesn't seem to be replying as fast since these are technically not critical reports. There aren't very many that don't need responses from the business so I will work on those. Still doing some C# development on the said for that program rewrite but I think I need some feedback from those at the office that have actually used the program since right now there isn't much point in rewriting if it is just going to be a complete copy paste in terms of functionality. The main goal of this is to make it more functional to use and implement some lacking features. Enhancements which could be implemented as a result of feedback from other people who have used the program. There are still things that I need to figure out how to do exactly some things in C# but that is the fun part of learning and making things with different languages. It also proves to me even further that C# is just a better language for a project like this.
