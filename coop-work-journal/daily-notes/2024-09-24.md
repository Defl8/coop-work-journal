Matt came by office today and asked about the analyzer I was making for him. It wasn't really in working state since I have been busy with other stuff. So I told Sean hey I'm focusing on the this thing for Matt. I managed to get the calculation for the slope using the least squares regression formula after extensive testing. Honestly, I should've been able to do it sooner but I forgot how to order of operations which led me astray for a while. I eventually was able to replicate the empirical data I was given to test my functions to get some values. After that I moved on the figuring out how to handle the large dataset. As mentioned before this data set is over 1million rows in size so this is an important things to keep in mind if we want the script to finish in a reasonable amount of time. This of course means using python libraries like numpy and pandas to handle the data. I've mentioned these before but the main draw to using these libraries is that they are specifically designed for large datasets and have methods and principles for handling them. One of the most important ones is vectorization. Vectorization allows you to apply operations to an entire dataset as oppose to iterating over every single value in the data set and getting a result. This makes script involving lots of data alot quicker and more efficient.
