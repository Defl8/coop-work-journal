Still doing some script work. I had an inkling that the script might have some data loss somewhere maybe due to the data type of the data in the dataframe or series. I loaded up the script in visual studio code for the debugger set some breakpoints. After iterating over my code a couple times I found that this was indeed a problem. The vectorization methods I was using took a slight shifted column replica of the data and calculated the difference between the two and returned a number representing the difference of each value across the two copies of the same dataset.  However these values were not being maintained as floats to hold their decimal places despite my efforts to do so. So I tried a couple methods to keep them as floats but I couldn't manage to keep them as such. So with this in mind I opted to switch back to a traditional looping construct to manually iterate over the column of data and then compare each value to it's previous and then determine if there is 60 in a row.  This took a while to rework cause I had to fiddle with data types but overall it went well and I got the program working again with only a minor performance hit.
