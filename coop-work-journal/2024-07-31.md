Well I wrapped up the script programming today I think. I reverted back to the traditional looping construct I mentioned before to check for values instead of vectorization. I tested this and this made more sense to use then vectorization especially after testing. Much simpler too debug too. So now I am alot more confident that my functions are working correctly and the program is spitting out an accurate value. With this done I have to wait for Chris to come back from vacation next week to show him a more developed version of what I wrote. I had a lot of fun writing the program which makes me kinda wish I was at a position where I got to do more traditional programming but that's fine for now. Afterwards Sean put me onto making an excel file that one of our clients used daily to be compatible with the new system they use and the excel add in that is now compatible with 64 bit version of excel. This is proving to be a little tricky to implement
