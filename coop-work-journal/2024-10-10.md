More report work today. This is probably how my days are mostly gonna go from now on. My current workflow is boot up my work computer. Hop on to the remote server. If I made any changes that involves data recording, I would go into the query tool and check if those values are updating correctly. If they are then I move onto other things. Otherwise I do some trouble shooting to see if  I can figure out why things are not updating correctly. Once that is done I usually move onto the report tracking sheet to see if anything has updated. At this point, my reports that I'm responsible for are relying on some tags that are miscalculating their values. Since Sean is responsible for updating those, I'm pretty much waiting on him for those to be fixed before I can proceed, and in some cases he is waiting on other people at the client to help him figure the tags out before they can be fixed and implemented. Pretty much all the reports I'm doing are at this point. Then there is the spreadsheets that need to be fixed
