# 2024-06-14
Continuing on with HMI stuff, basically today was spent chugging through the remainder of the changes from the HMI release notes and wrapping any minor things that needed to be added. This new HMI I am currently working on is very similar to the previous one so the changes went significantly quicker as I am familiar with the software and how the HMIs are laid out. It feels nice to be comfortable with the software and knowing that the only thing slowing me down is my energy level and my ability to stay focused. I wrapped up the changes by noon, ate my lunch and then asked around for anymore work.
