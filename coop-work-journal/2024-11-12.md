# 2024-11-12
Well today I got confirmation that I will for sure be going to the client on site and in person on Thursday. Seems like I will be showing up there sometime between 8 and 8:30 in the morning, this will allows us enough time to head to the locations we need to be at and get started around 8:30 and 8:45. The basic plan right now is to just be present and provide support for the operators that need it. Jodi let us know that they should be mostly comfortable with using the reports since they have been pretty much full time since august.
