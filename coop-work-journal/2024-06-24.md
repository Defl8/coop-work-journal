Did some more HMI development stuff today.  I wrapped up making the alarm bundles today. I had to do something interesting for the newest one since it had so many alarm fisheyes on it. Since there was upwards of fifty alarms a second page need to be made. This basically means that a whole other window is made for the alarms and linked to the first one via a button or some sort of object using a script. This script uses a built in method that when given a window name, brings the window up up at a specific x and y location on the screen, all of theses are passed as arguments for the method. I linked a method like this to a button object on the HMI screen which just call this method. Otherwise the new window is identical, bundle name at the top list of bypass alarms with the same layout except for the page number indicated at the top next to the previously mentioned button.
